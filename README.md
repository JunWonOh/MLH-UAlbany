# Office-Hours-MLH

A free, easy to use video conferencing website. Great for low bandwidth calls, as well as collaborating on diagrams through an interactive white board.

## How it works
Hosts simply generate and share tokens with others to set up a private call. Participants in a call can collaborate on a whiteboard, which is less intensive computationally and on bandwidth than screen sharing. This makes the website a great alternative to Zoom for those using lower end hardware. Using Auth0, users only need an existing Google account to register in seconds.
